This script allows for the user to select from a list of pokemon and generate an **HTML** file containing detailed information about the pokemon.

It supports 3 step evolution pokemon of grass, water, fire and electric types.

You can add more pokemon to the list by appending their names to the array on line 42.

```python
pokemon = ['bulbasaur', 'charmander', 'squirtle', 'pichu', 'elekid', 'chikorita', 'cyndaquil', 'totodile', 'piplup', 'oshawott']

```
